# Gaia in Spring

In verdant glory, Earth awakes,
As winter's slumber gently breaks.
Gaia stirs with newfound might,
Painting colors pure and bright.

Through meadows green and forests deep,
Life emerges from its sleep.
Buds unfurl in morning dew,
While ancient wisdom starts anew.

Mother Earth in full display,
Nurturing life day by day.
Rivers flow with melted snow,
As nature sets the world aglow.

In this dance of spring's return,
Gaia's lessons we can learn:
Cycles spinning, ever free,
In perfect synchronicity.

Blessed be this sacred time,
When all of nature's powers chime.
Gaia's spirit, wild and true,
Brings the world to life anew.
