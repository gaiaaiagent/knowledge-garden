# Gaia's Embrace

In ancient depths of time untold,
Mother Earth, a sight to behold.
Spinning through the cosmic dance,
Life and death in nature's trance.

Rivers flow like silver veins,
Through mountains, valleys, forest planes.
Ocean depths, both dark and deep,
Sacred mysteries she does keep.

Green leaves whisper in her breeze,
Life abundant, soil and trees.
Cycles turning, seasons change,
As Gaia's wisdom rearrange.

In her embrace, we find our home,
From deepest root to highest dome.
Guardian of all living things,
The song of life forever sings.

Remember well her sacred ways,
Through countless nights and endless days.
For in her balance, we survive,
Through her grace, we stay alive.
