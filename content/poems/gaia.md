# Gaia's Song

Mother Earth, ancient and wise,
Spinning through the starlit skies.
Life-giver, nature's sacred soul,
Keeping all the seasons whole.

Rivers flow through veined terrain,
Forest breath and gentle rain.
Mountains rise in silent might,
Oceans dance in day and night.

Sacred keeper of all things,
From smallest seed to eagle's wings.
In your cycles, ever true,
Life eternal flows through you.

Guardian of earth and sea,
All existence flows from thee.
Gaia, mother, spirit strong,
Teaching us where we belong.
